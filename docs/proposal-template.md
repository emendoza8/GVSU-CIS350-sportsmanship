# Introduction

The project our team will be working on is a Fantasy Football app. Our initial concept is to allow users to draft a team and then to set a line up every week inorder to go head to head against another user. Once a user has drafted there team it cannot be changed for the remander of the season but users can adjust what players they use on a week to week basis. Each roster will consist of 16 players. Every week the user will choose 9 of these players to start and leave the remaining 7 on the bench. The starter positions will include: one quarterback, two running backs, two wide recievers, one tight end, one flex player, one kicker, and one defense. We will also be implicating a point system that will be determined based on the stats from each player during that week. Once that week is complete whichever user has more points will then recieve a point towards there overall team. The overall objective is to end the season with the most overall points.

When the app is first opened the user will be prompted to enter a team name of there chose. Once both users have completed this task a prompt will appear to ready up for the draft. Once the draft has begun the app will randomly choose one of the users to pick first following there pick the opposing user will draft. This order will be reversed every round. Each player will be given 30 seconds to make there chose. If they fail to do so a random player will be drafted to there team. 

The user interface of this app will be clean and simple. It will consist of multiple tabs such as your team, matchup, settings, and potentially news to show users game scores and information on players. The team tab will be where the user can set there line up. The matchup tab will allow players to see there team in comparison to there opponents. Furthermore, this will be where you will see both users scores during the week. Lastly, the settings tab will allow users to do things such as change there team name, maybe change the color scheme of the interface and whatever other features we feel the user should be able to control.

# Anticipated Technologies

Our team has decided to create this app using python. All members of the team have had atleast some experience with this language. We are looking to make this app for iphones therefore we will need to use some sort of development environment such as Xcode.

# Method/Approach

The method our team will be using is some form of Agile such as scrum. We beileve this will work best as it will allow us to have frequent meetings and deligate the work appropriately. In addition, it will allow us more versatility will our project. Since we are starting quite simple this will allow us to expand as we see fit. This may include larger leagues, the ability to trade players throughout the season, and discussion boards between users.

# Estimated Timeline

The first milestone is to get a working app that has all of the basic structure we layed out such as the draft, line ups, point system, and a simple interface. This first milestone should take our team between two and three weeks. The next milestone is to pull information from the internet into the app to update scores and stats during the games. Implementing this part of the app is predicted to take around a week. We will then spend a few days testing all of these existing features to insure everything is working correctly. This means our team plans to have a basic working form of this app completed within a 4 and 5 weeks. Following this we will begin perfecting the interface and implimenting new features as listed above. The overall goal is to have a fully tested and functioning app with additional features within 8 weeks. 

# Anticipated Problems

There are a few problems that our team expects to arise. The first problem is deciding what environment to develop this app in. Our team has very little experience with app development so we will have to spend time learning some new tools before beginning. Furthermore, we must find a way to update information within the app to follow games as they take place. Next, we will have to consider other platforms such as android and we see expanding and testing for cross platform to be an obstacle in the future. Lastly, we will need to find a way to connect users using some sort of server. Similar to app development we do not have much experience and will have to spend time learning and implimenting this.
