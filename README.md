# Sportsmanship

Our team will be working on a Fantasy Football app for our term project. Our minimum viable product will feature a minimum of two users drafting rosters of 16 NFL players and facing each other in head-to-head competition. The team whose players generate a higher score for a week’s worth of NFL games will earn a point in the overall season standings, where weekly user scores are be based on their players’ stats in live games. The general goal for users is to earn the most total matchup points by the end of the season.
