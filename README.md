# Sportsmanship

Our team will be working on a Fantasy Football simulation app for our term project. Our app will begin by taking the user to a login screen where they can set their team name and begin the draft. The draft feature will allow a user to draft a team of 9 players using a classic draft style format with a timer and player counter. Once the draft has ended the user can view the total fantasy points of their team along with individual stats from each player.
